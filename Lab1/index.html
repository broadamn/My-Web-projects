          If the Samsung S22 Ultra was the ultimate evolution of a slab-style
          smartphone, then the Galaxy S23 Ultra is a victory lap
        </h2>
        <p>Everything that the <b>S22</b> was and a little extra</p>
      </header>
      <section>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          The S23 Ultra offers a handful of updates and a new main camera
          sensor. There are no groundbreaking new features. It doesn’t fold in
          half. Until someone invents radically improved battery technology or
          holographic displays, that’s just going to be the case for the Ultra
          for the foreseeable future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other side of that coin is that the S22 Ultra was already really
          good, and the S23 Ultra is a little better. Performance — delivered
          by a custom Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset — is whip fast. The updated
          camera system is capable of stunning feats. And a couple of small
          tweaks — the phone’s slightly reshaped side rails and screen — have
          a big impact on the device’s likability.

          The phone’s slightly reshaped side rails and screen have a big
          impact on the device’s likability
        </h4>
        <p>
          That’s all good news. The bad news is that it remains a very
          expensive device at $1,200, which is a bit more than a $1,099 iPhone
          14 Pro Max and a big leap from the Pixel 7 Pro’s $899 starting
          price. There are some familiar sore spots with Samsung software,
          like its insistence on including its own app store in addition to
          Google’s. And although the camera system can produce stunningly good
          images, it occasionally makes weird choices and comes up with a
          photo that’s just downright bad.
        </p>

        <p>
          But if you can stomach the price and the occasional weird photo,
          then I think you’ll find the S23 Ultra’s maximalism highly
          rewarding.

        <h4>Big jump in performance</h4>
        <p>
          The Galaxy S23 Ultra uses Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset.
          Excuse me, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 For Galaxy. It’s a slightly
          different version of the company’s top-shelf processor that’s a tiny
          bit faster than the garden-variety 8 Gen 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to the OnePlus 11 5G with the non-Galaxy 8 Gen 2, I could
          not tell you what difference this makes in practical use. The S23
          Ultra simply feels fast. Whipping through recently opened apps feels
          almost dizzying. There’s nothing I throw at it in day-to-day use
          that makes it flinch. It comes with 8GB or 12GB of RAM. The unit I
          tested has 12GB, but either one should stand up to demanding tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new chipset also runs much cooler than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 —
          after downloading Genshin Impact install files for 10 minutes with
          the loading animation playing (and the phone resting on a
          heat-insulating couch cushion), it was only slightly warm to the
          touch. The S22 Ultra was borderline uncomfortable to hold after
          doing something like that. Gameplay is incredibly smooth, with a
          barely perceptible hiccup here and there as it loads more area data.

                      The S23 Ultra has the same 5,000mAh battery capacity as
                      last year, but Samsung claims that battery performance
                      is improved, thanks to the processor upgrade — it’s
                      theoretically more battery-efficient than its
                      predecessor — and some tweaks to the display. Battery
                      stamina does, in fact, seem to be improved over the last
                      generation. The S22 Ultra often felt like it was
                      coasting on fumes at the end of a day of moderate use,
                      and I feel like I can wring a little more juice out of
                      this one. It’s not worlds better, but it gives you a
                      little more breathing room to get through your day.

                    <p>
                      My typical day includes about four hours of screen-on
                      time, and the S23 Ultra usually got me to the evening
                      with somewhere around 30 percent left. That includes
                      using the always-on display, which puts extra drain on
                      the battery. I tried putting it through the wringer on a
                      day with more intensive activities — navigation, a
                      30-minute Zoom call, 40 minutes of streaming video, lots
                      of camera use, including 4K video recording — all off of
                      Wi-Fi. That knocked the battery down to about 25 percent
                      by the end of the day. Truthfully, I could have gone a
                      little harder on the phone, but I came down with food
                      poisoning in the afternoon, which put a damper on my
                      ability to use the phone or do anything at all.

                      All that is to say you can get through a day of moderate
                      use with the S23 Ultra a little more comfortably, and it
                      stands up a bit better to heavier use. If you plan on
                      doing a lot of processor-heavy stuff like gaming or, I
                      don’t know, measuring every room in your house in VR,
                      then you’ll probably still need to recharge before the
                      day is done. For most of us, this is an all-day battery,
                      with a little more wiggle room than last year’s.

        <h4>One of the bests!</h4>
        <p>
          The S23 Ultra offers one of the most powerful mobile camera systems
          money can buy. It comes with both a 3x and 10x telephoto lens, an
          ultrawide, and of course, that shiny new 200-megapixel main camera.
          It’s capable of images that I honestly can’t believe I took with a
          smartphone, especially from the 10x to 30x zoom range. I took a
          picture of the top of the Space Needle from street level standing
          over half a mile away, and I can make out details like the elevators
          and people on the observation deck. That’s ridiculous.
